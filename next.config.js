/* const withImages = require('next-images')
module.exports = withImages() */

/* Okay, so I'm not gonna use next-images module on this project furthermore. 
I found a good solution about images with creating just a "config.js" file in general repository. 
I learned this technique from @thisisroi, you can look his projects in Github. 
Most of them were amazing btw! 
But, if you want to use your custom images in this project with this module, just delete these commands and check-out next-images documentation in npmjs.com. */
